Learn Django and Redis by visualizing Twitter data
==================================================

A workshop by Haris Ibrahim K V

----

Django has matured and evolved over the years to become the framework of choice
for many Python programmers out there. It makes web developement easy and
painless by providing tons of utilities out of the box.

Redis is ubiquitous in the current industry. The joy of using a fast and
reliable NoSQL database is inexplicable once you have already gone through that
phase of carefully designing all your tables while using a SQL database.

The tutorial will cover writing a Django application from step 0. The idea is to
allow a full hands on experience developing a Django web application. However,
the experience has to be gratifying and something that can be built upon.
Hence, over the process, we will cover fetching tweets from Twitter using the
Twython framework (boilerplate code) and visualizing it using Chart.js
(boilerplate code). Redis will be introduced to cover 3 simple use cases.
Implementing a leaderboard, implementing a counter and implementing cache.

These are 2 to 5 lines of code which makes a huge difference and impact on your
web application. Twython and Chart are going to be introduced as bolier plate
codes since it is so easy to tweak and learn it. The idea of this workshop is
to give a solid foundation in using Django and Redis together. In Django
itself, we will cover using models, forms, implementing views, how ORM works,
routing, templates, and how all these tie together during the flow of
development.

Here is the list of packages required for the workshop:
 - Python 2.7
 - Sqlite 3
 - Redis 2.8
 - Chart.js (http://www.chartjs.org/)
 - Have a virtualenv (http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org) up and running with
   the packages following packages installed:
   - Django==1.6
   - argparse==1.2.1
   - distribute==0.6.24
   - wsgiref==0.1.2
   - redis==2.10.3
 - Any Linux distro (preferable Ubuntu) If you have Windows, plase install
