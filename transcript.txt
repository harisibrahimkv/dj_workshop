Ladies and Gentlemen,

If I were standing before you to host the Tony awards or maybe the Oscars, I could be jumping about or dance around with scantily clad women and make an absolute fool of myself. However, since this is none of that, all I can say is that it is both a privilege and honor to be here, standing before you.

I could go on and on with this intro, but taking into consideration the fact that we only have roughly about two hours to go, I'll save the speech for the end. Let's get on with it. I'll just say that my name is Haris Ibrahim K V and I come from South India. So if you want to ask something in between the session, do call out my name and ask.

As you must have already gone through the abstract, you would know that this tutorial is about learning Django. However instead of explaining a "Hello, World" application, we are going to fetch, process and visualize Twitter data, plugging in redis to implement a few use cases.
